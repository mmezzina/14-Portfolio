                <p>Elite-average athete, nature tolerator, will go for a walk on the beach if I must and don't hate kids. This is not a dating profile, just a little bio about a little kid in a big kid's body who is travelling the path to coding and programming stardom. In reality children love me and I love them, I am always up for long walk on the beach, I love the great outdoors, and last but certinly not least, I am an elite-average athlete.

                <p><em>Your Way Design</em>, aims to deliver your business a website and other marketing material created in <strong>your</strong> image. My name is Marco and my aim is to work closely with you to bring your vision to fruition. I don't to generic templates, nor do I follow the crowd. When creating I like to think outside the box and develop something special and truely unique that you as a business owner will be proud of.</p>
                <p>After completing high school, I studied Clinical Exercise Physiology for three years at the University of South Australia before deciding this wasn't the path for me. One holiday to Europe and two years of full time work later I discovered the world of coding and instantly fell in love with everything about it. The highs of a program working after days or weeks of testing, to the lows of being stuck on a seemingly impossible task. I discovered web development and found my calling, with the opportunity to work in an ever growing industry and being able to work with businesses small and large and give them a way to grow and expand their business. Currently, alongside completing courses online through Codecademy and other similar sites, I am also enrolled in and part of the first ever cohort at <em>42 Adelaide</em>, a school dedicated to giving every individual the opportunity to learn how to code.</p>
                <p>My journey is only beginning and I hope to 
                work with you someday to help bring your visions to life. Visit the <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> page to get in touch with me and have a chat about how we can work together to make your dream a reality.</p>
